this is a chess engine/bot created using supervised learning (classification)

i have trained this engine on 40,000 games of tournament games recorded in .pgn files from various databases like chessgames.com, pgnmentor.com/files.html, etc.

if you want to make a better one, i would suggest running it on 5 epochs while training, and while labelling, use the depth of stockfish at above 20 for best results, preferably use all the games you can get,
i have more pgn files i could never use, due to the limitations of my cpu and the heat it was generating.

☝️9 million chess games, games worth almost 2.1TB of storage are available on database.lichess.org, if you have all the cpu in the world.

have fun!
